# Peckham Soup Kitchen - Next.js Project

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, created using the [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) template. It serves as the official website for the Peckham Soup Kitchen, a community initiative aimed at supporting and empowering the Southwark community.
